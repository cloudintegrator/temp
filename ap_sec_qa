What authentication mechanisms are required? (OAuth 2.0, JWT, Basic Auth, API Key, SAML, OpenID Connect, etc.)
Which identity provider (IdP) will be used? (Okta, Azure AD, PingFederate, Keycloak, etc.)
Are there different authentication methods for internal vs. external users?
Will there be role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC)?
Should multi-factor authentication (MFA) be enforced for API access?
Will an API Gateway be used for security enforcement? (Anypoint API Manager, AWS API Gateway, Apigee, etc.)
Are there rate limits or throttling requirements for API consumers? (E.g., 100 requests per minute per client.)
Should different rate limits be applied based on user roles or subscription tiers?
Should burst traffic handling be configured to prevent API abuse?
Will APIs have quotas per client to prevent overuse?
Should all APIs enforce HTTPS (TLS 1.2/1.3)?
Is mutual TLS (mTLS) required for authentication between services?
Are there specific encryption requirements for request/response payloads?
Will API requests include sensitive data that needs additional encryption (e.g., PII, financial data)?
Should API tokens/keys be rotated periodically?
How should APIs handle threats like SQL injection, XSS, and CSRF?
Are there requirements for Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) or Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)?
Will IP whitelisting/blacklisting be implemented?
Is API traffic monitoring required for anomaly detection?
Should security headers be enforced (CORS, Content-Security-Policy, etc.)?
Which logs need to be captured (request/response, authentication attempts, errors)?
Where should logs be stored (Anypoint Monitoring, Splunk, ELK, CloudWatch, etc.)?
How long should logs be retained for compliance?
Are there audit trail requirements for API access?
Does the API need to comply with standards like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, SOC2?
Will API keys be distributed securely to consumers?
Should API access be restricted based on geographic location (Geo-fencing)?
Are there requirements for API sandbox environments for testing?
Should developers have restricted access to production APIs?
How will API deprecation and versioning be handled securely?
What happens if an API key/token is compromised?
Is there an automated process for revoking access to compromised credentials?
What is the plan for handling DDoS attacks?
Should APIs be backed by multiple regions for failover?
Who is responsible for API security monitoring and incident response?
